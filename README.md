My name is Igor, I'm a cybersecurity student with focus on Pentesting. I made this github to share my projects of cybersecurity, like keyllogers, malware and exploits. 
I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
